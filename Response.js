When our host, Johanna, became a teacher, she found herself alone, creating her own activities, and to find ways to make math fun plus easy to implement...but it wasn’t exactly a piece of pi (or cake!).\nShe’s on a mission to solve those problems for teachers and show students just how awesome math can be! On Monday’s you’ll hear from teachers, professionals & students on their own journey, who use math in their everyday lives. And that’s what you can count on!
